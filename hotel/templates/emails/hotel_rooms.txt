You're eligible for space in one of our volunteer hotel rooms at this year's {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}!  If you accept, we'll assign you to a room with 3 - 4 other volunteers.  You can accept or decline this offer as part of our volunteer checklist at {{ c.URL_BASE }}/signups/login
{% if attendee.hotel_requests %}
Our records indicate that you've already filled out the hotel room form, so thanks for jumping on that so quickly!  You can edit the hotel room form anytime until {{ c.ROOM_DEADLINE|datetime }}.
{% else %}
If you want hotel room space, you must sign up by {{ c.ROOM_DEADLINE|datetime }}.
{% endif %}
All volunteers who receive hotel room space must sign up for at least {{ c.HOTEL_REQ_HOURS }} weighted hours worth of shifts, but you
won't be charged any money.  Let us know if you're interested in helping with setup and/or teardown shifts for {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, and
if we haven't already selected enough volunteers to help, you'll be approved for the extra night(s). Your department head will have to
approve these those nights and they can count towards the {{ c.HOTEL_REQ_HOURS }} hour requirement.

Please let us know if you have any questions.
