Generic single-database configuration.

For the time being, please DO NOT check revisions into the rams (ubersystem) repository. Instead, copy the directory into your event plugin and work within that event's DB.

To autogenerate migrations:
```bash
# Make changes to your models.py file(s) as appropriate
# DO NOT use sep reset_uber_db!
# Keep in mind, relationship "columns" are not real, you do not need migrations for them
cd /your/event-plugin
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Message for revision"
```

Be sure to check your revision and edit it as necessary; auto-generation is not perfect and may try to drop columns.

To run migrations:
`alembic upgrade head`

To "fast-foward" migrations, i.e., count them as being run without actually running them:
`alembic stamp head`

If you get any "ImportErrors" while auto-generating or running migrations, then it's likely that the system path is incorrect. This shouldn't happen but the relevant line in env.py is:
`sys.path.insert(0, os.path.realpath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..')))`
